# Distributed Cache System

Enterprise-grade distributed caching solution with intelligent cache warming, multi-tier storage, and cross-datacenter replication for high-availability applications.

## Key Features

- Multi-tier cache hierarchy (L1: In-memory, L2: Redis, L3: Persistent)
- Intelligent cache warming and prefetching
- Cross-datacenter replication with conflict resolution
- Advanced eviction policies and TTL management
- Real-time cache performance monitoring

## Performance Metrics

- Sub-millisecond cache hit response times
- 99.9% cache availability across datacenters
- Automated failover and recovery
