# GraphQL API Gateway

A scalable GraphQL API gateway that federates multiple microservices into a unified API layer with advanced caching and real-time capabilities.

## Features

- Federation of multiple GraphQL schemas
- Redis-based query caching
- Real-time subscriptions with WebSocket
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Rate limiting and query complexity analysis
- Comprehensive monitoring and metrics

## Architecture

Built using Apollo Federation to combine schemas from multiple microservices, providing a single GraphQL endpoint for clients while maintaining service independence.
